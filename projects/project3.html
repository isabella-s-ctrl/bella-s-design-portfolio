                        <p>This project was conducted through CMU's Business Technology Group (BTG) Product Studio, where I worked as part of a team to address a real campus service challenge.</p>
                        <p>The campus mailroom struggled with long lines and inefficient communication about wait times, creating frustration for both students and staff. Our goal was to increase efficiency in the pickup process, provide transparency about queue length and wait times, and improve the student user experience while reducing operational bottlenecks.</p>
                        <p>Efficient package pickup is a high-frequency, high-frustration task for students. Improving this service directly impacts student satisfaction and campus operations, making it a meaningful project with real-world impact.</p>

                <div class="problem-content">
                    <p>Long wait times and lack of real-time updates created significant frustration and inefficiency in the campus mailroom. Students had no clear sense of how long they would wait, staff had no structured way to communicate or manage throughput, and the experience varied dramatically depending on day and time.</p>
                    <p>The core challenge was creating a solution that balanced simplicity for students with scalability for campus operations, while addressing the fundamental need for reliable, transparent information about line length, wait time, and pickup progress.</p>
